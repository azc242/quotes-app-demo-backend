# Purpose
This project was built to demonstrate [how to incorporate Node.js backend to React.js frontend](https://medium.com/@azc242/how-to-connect-a-react-frontend-with-node-js-bccb1fb7e2bb).
## Usage
In order to run this app functionally, the [frontend](https://github.com/azc242/quotes-app-demo-frontend) should also be running.
To simply run the backend, run the script below and open to view in browser. This will show a JavaScript object in JSON form with a quote (with key "text") and author of the quote. Refreshing the page will generate a new one.
